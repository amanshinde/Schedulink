# SmartMeet - Intelligent Meeting Scheduler

SmartMeet is an intelligent meeting scheduling application that finds the optimal meeting times based on participants' availability preferences. The application uses UTC time format consistently across all components to ensure accurate scheduling across different time zones.

## üé® Design Philosophy & Color Palette

SmartMeet features a futuristic, elegant design with a carefully curated color palette:

### Core Colors
- **Burgundy** (#6D3E49): Used for headers, unavailable time slots, and important UI elements
- **Caramel** (#CA995E): Used for primary buttons, available time slots, and highlight elements
- **Cream** (#F0E1DD): Used for secondary buttons, if-needed time slots, and background elements

### Complementary Colors
- **Dark Plum** (#2D1A20): A deeper shade used for backgrounds and depth effects
- **Gold Highlight** (#E5B980): A lighter accent used for highlights and gradients

### Futuristic Design Elements
- **Angular Shapes**: Asymmetric polygons and angled edges create a modern, tech-forward appearance
- **Subtle Gradients**: Strategic use of single-color gradients for depth without overwhelming the design
- **Geometric Accents**: Diamond shapes and precise geometric elements add visual interest
- **Grid Patterns**: Subtle background patterns enhance the futuristic aesthetic
- **Clean Typography**: Bold, uppercase headings with increased letter spacing for readability

This approach creates a sophisticated, future-oriented interface that maintains visual clarity while providing an engaging user experience.

## üì¶ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Database**: Google Sheets (via Google Sheets API)
- **Integration**: Google Calendar API (for syncing availability and creating events)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based token authentication

## üöÄ Project Phases

### üü© Phase 1: Project Setup & User Interface
- Set up folder structure: /frontend, /backend, /public, /views
- Create basic frontend pages:
  - Landing Page
  - User Registration Page
  - Weekly Schedule Input Page (color-coded calendar)
  - Organizer Meeting Creation Page
- Use HTML/CSS/JS to enable color-coded schedule input with Red/Yellow/Green slots

### üü® Phase 2: Backend Setup & Google Sheets Integration
- Initialize Node.js project
- Set up Express server
- Integrate Google Sheets API:
  - Store each user's weekly availability as rows
  - Structure: Name | Day | Time Slot | Availability (R/Y/G)
- Create routes for:
  - User schedule submission
  - Fetching schedules for selected users

### üü¶ Phase 3: Meeting Scheduling Logic (AI )
- Accept from the organizer:
  - Desired date
  - Duration (e.g. 1 hour)
  - Selected participants
- Backend logic:
  - Read participant schedules from Google Sheets
  - Find overlapping green/yellow slots
  - Rank time slots by # of greens > # of yellows
  - Return top 3 suggestions

### üüß Phase 4: Google Calendar Integration
- Integrate Google Calendar API:
  - Allow users to authenticate with Google
  - Fetch busy slots automatically (if preferred over manual entry)
  - Create event for confirmed meeting
  - Send calendar invites to participants

### üü• Phase 5: Notifications & Final Touches
- Add email notifications (SendGrid/Nodemailer optional)
- UI improvements: show suggestions in a visual calendar view
- Build logic for sending "adjust request" emails to yellow slots
- Optional: add "remove red participants" fallback option

## üñåÔ∏è UI Elements & Color Usage

### Availability Indicators
- **Available** (Caramel #CA995E): Indicates times when a user is fully available
- **If Needed** (Cream #F0E1DD): Indicates times when a user can be available if necessary
- **Unavailable** (Burgundy #6D3E49): Indicates times when a user cannot attend

### Buttons
- **Primary Buttons** (Caramel #CA995E): Used for main actions like submitting forms
- **Secondary Buttons** (Cream #F0E1DD): Used for alternative actions

### Page Elements
- **Header** (Burgundy #6D3E49): Main navigation and branding area
- **Feature Cards** (White with Caramel border): Highlight key features on the landing page
- **Meeting Indicators** (Caramel #CA995E): Show scheduled meetings on the calendar
- **Notification Badges** (Burgundy #6D3E49): Alert users to new notifications
